# vue2-storybook

Simple boilerplate app demonstrating how to set up <a href='https://storybook.js.org'>Storybook</a> with Vue 2 & Vuetify 2.Special thanks to Morgan Benton's <a href='https://morphatic.com/2020/09/30/configuring-storybook-6-for-vue-2-vuetify-2-3/'>immeasurably helpful post</a> for pointing me in the right direction in getting this up and running. The basic Storybook Vue components and accompanying stories are still in place. I've added a simple Vuetify  button and a very simple story to demonstrate PoC. I like SCSS so config for SCSS is also included.
